# 1D-Classification-using-threshold-classifier
There are two sub-species of these snowfolks. One sub-species lives in the Assam region of the Himalayas. The other lives on the other side, in the Bhutan region â€“ closer to Tibet. I'll build a one-dimensional binary classifier based on an observable attribute to classify them. I will write a program that writes a program.
